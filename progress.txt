# NanoChat .NET - Progress Log

## Phase 1: Project Foundation - COMPLETE ✅

### Date: February 5, 2026

### Completed Stories:

**Story 1.1: Create solution and project structure**
- Created NanoChat.sln solution file
- Created NanoChat.Core class library (src/NanoChat.Core)
- Created NanoChat.CLI console application (src/NanoChat.CLI)
- All projects target .NET 9.0 (LTS)
- Solution builds successfully with no warnings

**Story 1.2: Add TorchSharp-cpu dependency**
- Added TorchSharp-cpu v0.105.2 to Core and CLI projects
- Created TensorExample class with tensor creation and matmul tests
- CLI application successfully creates tensors and runs matrix multiplication
- Verified TorchSharp integration works correctly

**Story 1.3: Add test project**
- Created NanoChat.Core.Tests xUnit test project (tests/NanoChat.Core.Tests)
- Added tests for TensorExample (CanCreateTensor, CanRunMatmul)
- All tests pass successfully
- Test project added TorchSharp-cpu reference for native library access

### Technical Notes:

**Framework:**
- Using .NET 9.0 (LTS) instead of .NET 10 for better library compatibility
- TorchSharp-cpu v0.105.2 with libtorch 2.7.1

**Dependencies:**
- TorchSharp-cpu (includes native libtorch libraries for CPU)
- xUnit for testing

**Known Requirements:**
- macOS users need libomp installed: `brew install libomp`
- Native libraries are automatically copied to output directory
- All builds complete with 0 warnings
- All tests pass (2 passing)

### Build & Test Commands:

```bash
# Build
dotnet build NanoChat.sln

# Run CLI
dotnet run --project src/NanoChat.CLI/NanoChat.CLI.csproj

# Run Tests
dotnet test NanoChat.sln
```

### Next Steps:

Ready to proceed with Phase 1, Feature 2: Tokenizer
- Story 2.1: Create tokenizer interface
- Story 2.2: Implement tiktoken-based tokenizer
- Story 2.3: Add special token support
- Story 2.4: Load nanochat tokenizer from disk
- Story 2.5: Test against Python implementation
